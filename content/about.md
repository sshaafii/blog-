I'm Shaafi, a Quality Assurance Engineer specialising in performance testing and web automation for financial applications. This site documents my projects and what I'm learning along the way.

My day-to-day involves performance testing, web automation, and API testing—but I'm increasingly drawn to the infrastructure side of things. I'm currently building out a K3s homelab  and generally trying to get deeper into Linux, Kubernetes, and SRE practices.

I like understanding how systems break under pressure and using monitoring tools to figure out why.
